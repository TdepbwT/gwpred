# --- Updated team ratings after GW1 results and transfers ---
# Adjustments based on GW1 performance and new signings like Eze to Arsenal
#
# GW1 Results Summary:
# Liverpool 4-2 Bournemouth (Liverpool impressive attack, Bournemouth leaky defense)
# Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle United (Both teams underwhelming, cagey affair)
# Brighton 1-1 Fulham (Even contest, both showed decent quality)
# Sunderland 3-0 West Ham (Massive upset, Sunderland excellent, West Ham poor)
# Tottenham 3-0 Burnley (Spurs looked sharp, Burnley struggled)
# Manchester City 4-0 Wolves (City dominant as expected, Wolves outclassed)
# Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford (Forest impressive at home, Brentford disappointing)
# Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace (Both teams lacked cutting edge)
# Arsenal 1-0 Manchester United (Arsenal edged it, United looked poor)
# Leeds United 1-0 Everton (Leeds solid at home, Everton away struggles continue)
#
# Key Transfer: Ebere Eze moved from Crystal Palace to Arsenal for Â£68m
# This strengthens Arsenal's creative options significantly
